### Goal
The goal of the project is to provide a platform for interacting with physical devices in your home. Unlike many other platforms, first and foremost, everything should run locally and autonomously on the Hub without the need for a cloud solution. This of course would mean, short of exposing the hub service on your DMZ, you won't be able to access it over the Internet.
